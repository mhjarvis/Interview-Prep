## What is an object?
- A core concept of OOP. 
- Objects represent real-world entities (e.g. car, animal). 
- Objects have **states** (color, name, breed) and **behaviors** (playing, sleeping, eating). 
- Objects are instances of a class and often are created (or built) using the **new** keyword. 
- States are stored in fields and behavior is exposed via methods. 
- Each instance of an object takes space in memory and can communicate with other objects.
- Objects can have different access modifiers and visibility ranges, can be mutable, unmodifiable, or immutable, and are collected via a garbage collector.

## What is a class?
- A core concept of OOP.
- A class serves as a template or blueprint for creating objects.
- Classes do not consume memory.
- A class can be instantiated multiple times.
- A class does one, and only one, thing.

## What is the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**?
The principle that a class should be written to do only one thing.

## What is Inheritance?
- Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. 

## What is abstraction?
- A core concpt of OOP.
